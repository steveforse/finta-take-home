## TODO
So much to do here.

1. I created a model called Transaction. That obviously needs a rename.
2. Add paging support for upsert CC/Bank Accounts
3. Implement upsert CC Transactions (another cursor for CC trx, etc.)
4. Didn't get around to scheduling via whenever gem
5. For performanc reasons, maybe I should've made UUID the primary key in order to easily make use of uspert_all
6. Upserts could probably use some optimizations
7. Implement error handling for API requests
8. Auth key should probably in ENV var
9. Didn't get around to any of the frontend bits; probably been too long since I generated a RoR project (felt a bit rusty)
10. Needs tests
